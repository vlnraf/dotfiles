# Dotfiles

Hi to everyone. 
Welcome to my xmonad setup!

## Configuration

|Name              |                                                            |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
|OS                |[Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/)                             |
|Shell             |[ZSH + ohmyzsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)                          |
|Window Manager    |[Xmonad](https://xmonad.org/)                               |
|Terminal          |[Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)         |
|Editor            |[Neovim](https://neovim.io/) (Developer version)            |
|Panel             |[Xmobar](https://xmobar.org/)                               |
|Browser           |[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)       | 

to install the following system follow this steps:
- Run the zsh setup command:
```bash
    chmod +x zsh_setup.sh
    ./zsh_setup.sh
```
- Run the system setup command:
```bash
    chmod +x setup.sh
    ./setup.sh
```

When the installation is complete you have to reboot the system and select from the session menu in the display manager

use [`dual`](https://github.com/vlnraf/dotfiles/blob/master/.zshrc) or [`single`](https://github.com/vlnraf/dotfiles/blob/master/.zshrc) in the terminal to switch from the single monitor to double monitor or the other way.

### TODO

- I will try to do a bash script to install everything automatically and start the same config in another machine as soon as possible. (When i have a bit of time to work on it ðŸ˜…)
- Try to switch from dmenu to Rofi app launcher.
